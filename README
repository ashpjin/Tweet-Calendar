Calendar data file updated using cron job.
Uses d3.js for visuals.

File Breakdown:
-calendar.css: some visual directions

-csv_generator_norm.php: outputs a csv file with all percentage data for "leafing out" only
-csv_add_col.php: copies "norm_data.csv" to "temp.csv" with an additional column based on the search_id given in the file code; called by generate_csv.sh
-csv_update.php: adds one day of percentage day across all search_ids (i.e. one row of data); called by csv_update.sh
-csv_update.sh: bash script, run to update one day's worth of data in norm_data.csv (cron job)
-generate_csv.sh: calls csv_add_col.php and copies temp back to norm_data.csv

-leaf_dji.js: does d3 visual operations and pulls from norm_data.csv
-leaf_script.php: webpage code (contains html)

-norm_data.csv: contains all relevant data for rendering calendar visualizations
-temp.csv: used only by bash scripts to generate new data columns in norm_data.csv

-/outdated: past versions of php and js code 
    -> contains version that pulls directly from database and not from csv (SLOW!!!)
-/safekeeping_csv: past versions of csv files
-/test: test files; generally purposeless at current time




Known/Open Issues:
- csv_update.sh: reads from table in database for the current year average
     -> average is manually inputted for the current year (2012), when year becomes 2013 the averages will no longer be accurate
	 -> no efficient script to calculate average atm (hacking it out of csv_add_col with printf)
- year normalization from Jan1 to Dec31, possibility that this may skew results for "Winter" and similar terms because the peak season may be divided in the middle
- Blank dates with no data between 11-09-2010 and 2-19-2011 because no collection occurred
     -> zeros will be inserted into csv file if new csv generated, must manually delete these dates at the moment
- leaf_dji.js: hardcoded to generate image objects for years 2009 - 2012 (says 2013 but is non-inclusive), will not display past 2012 unless updated manually
- Server may be running in different time zone than expected; cron job might not operate as expected
     -> server "day begin" is 7:00:00 AM GMT corresponding to 12:00:00 PM US/Pacific
- Some files contain relative URLS
     -> be cautious when moving directories
